# ImgCIFHandler

This Julia package provides a single function `imgload` which will load raw
data images referenced by imgCIF files. imgCIF is a raw data standard developed
by the International Union of Crystallography, and recently enhanced with data
pointers so that the raw data can be preserved outside of the imgCIF file 
itself.

# Installation

## Prerequisites

For some functions, the programs `tar`, `curl` and `awk` must be available in the environment, 
as well as `gzip` and `bunzip2`. This requirement may be removed in the future.

## Installation

To install this package, at the Julia package prompt (reached by typing `]` at the Julia prompt) type `add ImgCIFHandler`.

# Use

After installation, typing 'using ImgCIFHandler' will import the package. A single function `imgload` will be in scope. This function can be used to
access raw data stored using pointers within imgCIF files. The example file [`b4_master.cif`](test/testfiles/b4_master.cif) contains such pointers.
For example, to read the raw data array labelled `ext1` in `b4_master.cif` the following call is used:

```julia
x = imgload("b4_master.cif","ext1")
```

Note that this command will only work if the images referred to in `b4_master.cif` actually exist. To create those files locally, unpack the 
`b4_mini.tar.bz2` contents into location `test/testfiles/test_cbf_unzipped`.

# Supported external formats

This release supports `HDF5`, `CBF`, and `SMV` (ADSC) formats, as well as Tar archives (optionally compressed using Bzip2 or Gzip) or 
Zip archives containing files in those formats. In all cases the format stated by the imgCIF file is used.
